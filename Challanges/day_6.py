 Challenge: Daily Learning Journal Logger

Build a Python script that allows you to maintain a daily learning journal. Each entry will be saved into a `.txt` file along with a timestamp.

Your program should:
1. Ask the user what they learned today.
2. Add the entry to a file called `learning_journal.txt`.
3. Each entry should include the date and time it was written.
4. The journal should **append** new entries rather than overwrite.

Bonus:
- Add an optional rating (1-5) for how productive the day was.
- Show a confirmation message after saving the entry.
- Make sure the format is clean and easy to read when opening the file.

Example:
ðŸ“… 2025-06-14 â€” 10:45 AM
Today I learned about how list comprehensions work in Python!
Productivity Rating: 4/5
"""
from datetime import datetime
entry = input("What did you learn today? ").strip()
now = datetime.now()
formatted_time = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d â€” %I:%M %p")
rating = input("Rate your productivity today (1-5, optional): ")

journal_entry = f"ðŸ“… {formatted_time}\n{entry}\n"

if rating:
    journal_entry += f"Productivity Rating: {rating}/5\n"

journal_entry += "-" * 40 + "\n"

with open("learning_journal.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(journal_entry)
print("Your entry has been saved")
